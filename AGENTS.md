This file provides guidance to OpenAI Codex, Antigravity, and AI agents working in this repository.

## Project overview

Gaffa is a dynasty fantasy football platform for the Premier League, live at [gaffa.live](https://gaffa.live).
- **Core product spec & architecture**: See `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`.
- **Game mechanics & intent**: See `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`.
- **Verification**: Run `npm run build` and `npm test` before declaring work complete.

## 1. Frontend & UI design requirements

Before modifying, designing, or refactoring any UI components, CSS modules, layout, or typography:

1. **Read `DESIGN.md`**:
   - Design tokens: Cream ground (`--color-bg-primary: #F8F4EC`), card surfaces, and the green ramp (`globals.css`).
   - Typography roles: Newsreader serif (`--font-serif`) for display/names/scores, Archivo Narrow (`--font-condensed`) for column heads/badges/buttons, JetBrains Mono (`--font-mono`) for live ticking figures, Hanken Grotesk (`--font-sans`) for body.
   - Mobile standards: Dynamic viewport (`dvh`), safe-area insets, bottom sheets on `<640px`, and touch targets.
   - Banned anti-patterns: No title kickers/eyebrows, no colored left-edge container stripes, no uncalibrated neon drop shadows, no heavy wireframe borders, no generic bento formulas.

2. **Check `docs/DECISIONS.md` before making design decisions**:
   - Only decisions documented in `docs/DECISIONS.md` are binding from Duke.
   - Do not invent rules or cite past agent inferences as binding decisions.

## 2. Writing style: Google Developer Style (anti-AI slop)

All frontend UI copy, microcopy, error messages, docs, commit messages, and assistant responses must adhere to the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide (`developers.google.com/style`) to eliminate "Claude-lish" AI assistant mannerisms.

### Rules of style:

1. **Voice and person**:
   - Use active voice addressed to the human ("Click Submit").
   - **No inanimate agency**: Tools, keys, buttons, containers, tabs, dialogs, and rules do not perform actions. Never write "Enter opens it", "Escape closes the modal", "this button submits", "the tab displays", "an asking price invites offers", or "the clause ends the auction".
   - **Affordances as infinitives or imperatives**: State keyboard shortcuts and interactions as infinitive purpose ("Enter to open · Esc to return · Ctrl+C twice to quit") or direct imperatives ("Press Enter to open"), never as keys acting as grammatical subjects.
   - Address the reader as "you", not "we" (cut "we recommend", "we can see that").

2. **Tone**:
   - Direct, conversational, and plainspoken.
   - **No throat-clearing**: Never start responses with "Certainly!", "Great question!", "I'd be happy to help!", or "Absolutely!". Answer directly.
   - **No polite filler**: Do not say "please" on routine instructions ("Click Save", not "Please click Save").

3. **Word choice**:
   - **Cut filler words**: Delete "simply", "easily", "just", and "obviously".
   - **Ban enabler phrasing**: Ban both "allows you to" and "lets you". Never make the UI element the subject of an enablement verb ("This tab lets you view" → "View your squad" or "Squad overview"). Use specific verbs (view, edit, open).
   - **No anthropomorphized status tags**: Avoid pseudo-passive status tags like "if it holds" — write concise, direct sports-journal copy ("projected €34m", not "€34m if it holds").
   - **No hedge-stacking**: Cut "it is worth noting that", "this might potentially", etc. Say the fact directly.

4. **Punctuation and formatting**:
   - **Em-dash restraint**: Do not use em dashes as a continuous sentence-joining crutch. Split thoughts into clean sentences.
   - **Prose over bulleted lists**: Do not list-ify everything. Write natural prose paragraphs by default. Reserve lists only for sequential steps or genuinely parallel options.
   - **Sentence case**: Use sentence case for headings, section titles, and button labels ("Submit proposal", not "Submit Proposal" or "SUBMIT PROPOSAL").
   - **Selective bolding**: Use bold only for actual UI elements or key terms, not for manufacturing artificial emphasis on ordinary nouns.
   - **Serial comma**: Always use the Oxford comma.

## 3. Agent skills policy

### Recommended skills:
- **`emil-design-eng`**: Implements §4.A of `DESIGN.md` (button press physics, modal/drawer transitions, origin-aware popovers, snappy <250ms threshold).
- **`apple-design`**: Implements §4.B of `DESIGN.md` (mobile touch ergonomics, dynamic viewport `dvh`, safe-area insets, bottom sheets).
- **`google-dev-style`**: Guides all UI copy, error messages, docs, and communication.
- **`modern-web-guidance`**: Provides modern CSS APIs (`:has()`, container queries, modern dialog/popover) instead of JS workarounds.
- **`impeccable` (in `Operate` mode)**: High-density dashboard, data table, and app shell refinement.
- **`full-output-enforcement`**: Prevents code truncation and placeholder comments.
- **`animate`**: Targeted CSS and Framer Motion transitions calibrated to Gaffa's tokens.

### Banned skills (do not use in this repo):
- **`industrial-brutalist-ui`**: Conflicts with Gaffa's calm European broadsheet journal identity; enforces military/CRT terminal aesthetics and all-caps headings.
- **`high-end-visual-design` (`soft-skill`)**: Mandates title eyebrows (banned by Duke), bans sticky topbars (violates the green topbar), and forces pill buttons.
- **`design-taste-frontend` (`taste-skill` v1/v2) & `gpt-taste`**: Designed for marketing landing pages/portfolios, not dashboards or data tables; attempts to introduce Tailwind and GSAP marketing heroes.
- **`minimalist-ui`**: Bans colored header sections (breaks green topbar) and forces monochrome `#111111` buttons with pastels, conflicting with the green ramp and 12 tactical position colors.
- **`stitch-design-taste`**: Designed to generate new `DESIGN.md` files from scratch; risks overwriting Gaffa's custom palette and locked decisions.
- **`image-to-code`**: Scaffolds disposable marketing pages from synthetic mockups rather than working inside Gaffa's design system.

## 4. Resource limits, server efficiency, and cost awareness

All AI agents must actively design and execute for cost and resource efficiency. Never blindly invoke remote endpoints, introduce unthrottled polling, or run heavy data workloads through production serverless functions.

### Tool & service limits

1. **Vercel (Hobby compute)**:
   - **Limits**: 1,000,000 Function Invocations per rolling 30-day window; 4 Fluid Active CPU hours per month.
   - **Prefer local compute for batch work**: When generating scouting outlooks, backfilling data, or running multi-minute syncs, run them locally via CLI scripts (`scripts/...` or `tsx ...`) directly against Postgres. Do not route heavy batch jobs through Vercel serverless functions when a local script can do it.
   - **Avoid unthrottled remote loops**: Do not repeatedly hammer remote Vercel API routes in loops if a direct database query or local script achieves the same result. Only invoke remote routes when testing them or when no local equivalent exists.
   - **No client-side polling**: Do not use `setInterval` to poll Next.js API routes from client components. Use Supabase Realtime WebSockets directly (which bypass Vercel serverless compute entirely).

2. **Supabase (Postgres & Realtime)**:
   - **Limits**: Free tier storage, 200 concurrent Realtime connections, 500 MB DB size.
   - **Batching & pagination**: Avoid N+1 queries. PostgREST truncates queries at 1,000 rows, so paginate (`.range()`) whenever querying large tables (`player_stats`, `sofifa_position_reference`).
   - **Use database RPCs**: Prefer Postgres RPCs and stored procedures for complex transactions (bids, trades, payouts) instead of multiple round trips from application code.
   - **Channel cleanup**: Always clean up Realtime subscriptions on component unmount (`supabase.removeChannel(channel)`).

3. **Google Gemini / AI Studio (Scouting reports & outlooks)**:
   - **Limits**: Monthly spend cap on Google AI Studio project.
   - **Cache search queries**: Share head-coach and club queries across players. Do not regenerate outlooks that already match the current `PIPELINE_VERSION`. Respect `OUTLOOK_MONTHLY_GROUNDED_CAP`.

4. **External data sources (FPL, SoFIFA, Transfermarkt, API-Football)**:
   - **API-Football**: 100 requests per day limit.
   - **SoFIFA & Transfermarkt**: Scraping is blocked on cloud/CI IPs. Run only from local machines using existing tools (`playwright-sofifa.js`, `scripts/sync_transfermarkt_gaps.ts`).

### The efficiency principle

Before proposing or running any operational task, think: *How can we achieve the desired outcome with minimum remote invocations, lowest CPU time, and zero unnecessary API spend while maintaining speed and correctness?*
