/**
 * One builder for both deal types.
 *
 *   Offer  players and/or cash   ⇄   players and/or cash
 *   Loan   one player plus a contract (a stacked sheet, not a two-sided table)
 *
 * "Trade" and "Offer to buy" used to be separate modes, which was a fiction:
 * buy was trade with `offeredPlayerIds` forced empty and `requestedFaab` forced
 * to zero, hitting the same endpoint and the same table. Worse, it made the
 * manager pick a category before knowing what they wanted to put up, and
 * switching category wiped their selections. Now both sides simply hold players
 * and cash, and what the deal is CALLED is read off the payload afterwards by
 * `describeDeal` — a cash-for-one-player offer is a bid because of its shape,
 * not because anybody said so.
 *
 * It works on ANY player in the league. A listing is an advertisement, never
 * the only route in — `listing` merely pre-selects the counterparty and player
 * and lets the offer be tied to the listing so accepting it closes the auction
 * in the same transaction.
 *
 * Loan mode has its own sub-direction (`loanDirection`): "lend" proposes
 * loaning one of MY players out (`requestMode: false`, I set the terms as
 * lender); "borrow" requests a loan of one of THEIR players in
 * (`requestMode: true`, matching what `POST /loans` calls the borrower's
 * side). Both share the same fee-template math: a PPG-based base fee, three
 * templates (Fixed / Balanced / Performance-heavy) trading upfront fee for a
 * capped per-point bonus, and a ±20% adjustment on top.
