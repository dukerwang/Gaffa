/**
 * Gaffa — "Is this player actually still in the Premier League?"
 *
 * `players.is_active = false` is supposed to mean a player left the league. It
 * does not reliably mean that. `syncPlayersFromFpl` deactivates any stored row
 * it fails to match against the FPL bootstrap, and that matching is fuzzy — so
 * a spelling change, a renamed row, or a duplicate row for the same human all
 * produce a player who is marked departed while still very much playing.
 *
 * This is not theoretical. The known cases are Murillo, Joelinton, Konaté and
 * Gordon: a stale row and a live row for the same person, with the roster
 * pointing at the stale one. Anything that pays out or drops on the strength of
 * `is_active = false` alone will eventually pay real compensation for a player
 * who never left.
 *
 * Kickoff has always been gated on this (see kickoffPreflight's
 * `departed_player_still_in_pl` blocker). This module exists so the other
 * consumers — departure detection, and anything added later — can share the
 * same check rather than reimplementing it or, worse, going without.
