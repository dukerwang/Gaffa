/**
 * src/lib/players/cardData.ts
 *
 * Server-side data assembly for the premium player card.
 *
 * The card has two faces with very different cost profiles:
 *
 *   FRONT — identity, club, photo, rating, points, ranks, owner crest.
 *           Pure Supabase. Every field is already loaded by the list pages
 *           that open the card, so this should almost never be fetched at all.
 *
 *   BACK  — game log and career history. Needs FPL's element-summary /
 *           bootstrap / fixtures endpoints, which are slow and third-party.
 *
 * Keeping them apart is the whole point: the front must never wait on the
 * back. `/api/players/[id]/card` serves the front, `/api/players/[id]/log`
 * serves the back, and the legacy combined route composes both.
