/**
 * src/lib/clubs/registry.ts
 *
 * Canonical Premier League club registry, keyed by a stable slug.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * FPL's `teams[].id` is 1–20 assigned alphabetically over whichever 20 clubs
 * are in the division that season, so it is REASSIGNED every single year.
 * Keying anything durable on it silently rots at the summer rollover — and it
 * did: `public/team-logos/19.png` was West Ham's badge when it was committed
 * and became Spurs' badge after a re-download, because id 19 changed hands.
 *
 * So nothing here is keyed on that id. The slug is ours and never changes; a
 * relegated club keeps its entry and simply stops appearing in fixtures, and a
 * promoted club gets a new one. `fplCode` is FPL's OTHER identifier — a stable
 * per-club code (Man Utd is always 1, Arsenal always 3) that does not get
 * reassigned. It's only used to fetch badge art from the PL CDN.
 *
 * Look clubs up by NAME (`resolveClub`), which is what our tables actually
 * store in `players.pl_team`, never by season-scoped numeric id.
