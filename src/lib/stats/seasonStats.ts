/**
 * Season leaderboard data loading, shared by every stats surface and by the
 * positional-rank recompute job.
 *
 * The reason this is one module: the rank shown on a player card and the order
 * of the table beside it have to be derived from the same pool and the same
 * points. They were not — the ranks came from SQL over every player in the
 * database on their raw season total, the table from TypeScript over active
 * players on re-scored per-position points — which is how a striker could read
 * "#4" while sitting 2nd in the striker table (see migration 085).
 *
 * Pool rules:
 *   • archived season → every player with an archive row for it. They played
 *     that season; leaving the league afterwards does not remove them from its
 *     record, and a frozen historical rank must not shift when someone departs.
 *   • live season → active players only, which is all a live table can render.
 *
 * The leaderboard additionally opts into `includeActiveWithoutArchive`, and the
 * rank recompute does not. That asymmetry is the point: ranks are a closed
 * record of who actually played, while the table is also how you find a player
 * at all — search, position filters, the scouting modal. Between the rollover
 * and kickoff every stats surface resolves to LAST season, so an archive-only
 * pool made all three promoted clubs and every summer signing unfindable in the
 * app (137 of 560 active players at the 2026-27 rollover). They appear with
 * zeroes, which is what they have.
