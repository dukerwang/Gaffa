 * Single source of truth for the current FPL/fantasy season string.
 *
 * The season string format is "YYYY-YY" (e.g. "2025-26", "2026-27").
 * It is derived exclusively from the FPL bootstrap-static API — never
 * hardcoded — so season transitions happen automatically when FPL's data
 * switches over (mid-June each year).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const season = await getCurrentFplSeason();          // "2025-26"
 *   const season = await getLatestReferenceStatsSeason(adminClient); // from DB
 *
 * Both functions are lightweight and safe to call multiple times per
 * request — results are module-level cached for the lifetime of the
 * serverless invocation.
