 * One plain sentence for why an auction's clock is doing what it's doing.
 *
 * The mechanics (tier floors, the inactivity reset, the overnight guard) are
 * real and load-bearing, but nothing on a listing card or in the bid dialog
 * ever said so — the countdown just changed and a manager had to already know
 * the rule, or ask. This is the one thing to say for each state, not a
 * restatement of the whole timer.
