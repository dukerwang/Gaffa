/**
 * Gaffa — Departure Detection
 *
 * Turns "this rostered player is no longer in the Premier League" into a
 * pending decision the manager has to answer.
 *
 * Detection is not done here: `syncPlayersFromFpl` already marks players
 * `is_active = false` when FPL drops them from the bootstrap or flags their
 * status 'u'. This module only notices which of those are on a roster and
 * opens a decision for them.
 *
 * A player FPL reports as out on loan gets no decision. He is recorded as an
 * `on_loan` right instead and taken off the roster (loanAbroad.ts).
 *
 * Safe to run repeatedly. The partial unique index on (league_id, player_id)
 * over the open statuses (migration 160) is the real guard — this module filters first so a rerun is a no-op rather
 * than a burst of constraint violations.
