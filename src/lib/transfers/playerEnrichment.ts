/**
 * The canonical player stat/rank merge.
 *
 * `player_rankings` is a VIEW and cannot be nested-joined through PostgREST, so
 * every surface that shows a player has to fetch it separately and merge by
 * hand. That merge was duplicated in three places with three different shapes:
 *
 *   - `players/page.tsx:171-192`   — rankings + archive, including total_points
 *   - `trades/page.tsx:290-305`    — rankings + archive, WITHOUT total_points
 *   - `auctions/route.ts:180-190`  — neither
 *
 * The third is a live bug: the free-agent list renders correctly from the RSC
 * payload, then `TransferMarketClient` polls `GET /auctions` every 15 seconds
 * and overwrites it with unmerged rows — so `overall_rank`, `ppg` and
 * `form_rating` silently regress a few seconds after the page loads. Routing
 * everything through here fixes that by construction.
 *
 * This module takes the players/page.tsx shape (the superset) as canonical, so
 * the trades surface now also reads `total_points` from the archive when one
 * exists. That is the correct reading: during an archived season the live
 * `players.total_points` column has already been reset by the next sync.
