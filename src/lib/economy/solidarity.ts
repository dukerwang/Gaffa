/**
 * Gaffa — Transfer Recirculation (Solidarity + Scout's Fee)
 *
 * A winning free-agent bid, a drop severance fee and the loan slot buyback
 * were all previously destroyed outright — migration 060 comments the buyback
 * as "Deduct and burn fee". That made every large signing remove liquidity
 * from the league permanently, which is why a big transfer felt unrecoverable:
 * your squad is only sellable if somebody else still holds cash.
 *
 * This splits a share of the burned amount back into the league:
 *   - `share` of the amount forms a pool (default 20%).
 *   - `scoutShare` of that pool goes to the auction initiator (default 50%),
 *     so the scout receives 10% of the bid, uncapped.
 *   - The rest of the pool is split equally among the other non-winners.
 *   - Everything left burns, so a genuine drain survives.
 *
 * Football does this twice over: FIFA's solidarity mechanism distributes a
 * slice of every transfer fee to a player's former clubs, and the Premier
 * League's central pot is largely an equal share.
 *
 * Why 20% and not more: after this change free-agent bids are the ONLY
 * remaining sink, so `share` sets the league-wide signing spend needed to
 * break even — EUR 149m per team at 20%, EUR 178m at 33%, which no realistic
 * season reaches. 20% is close to the ceiling.
 *
 * This is the reference implementation. Migration 093 reimplements the same
 * arithmetic in PL/pgSQL, because the money must move atomically inside the
 * auction resolver. The tests beside this file are what keep the two honest —
 * change one and you must change the other.

 *                    prior manager bid, or an auction the system opened, pass false.
 * @param scoutIsPayer True when that scout also won. The fee is still paid, as
 *                    a rebate on their own bid, and they are the only club
 *                    left out of the equal split.
 *
 * Why the scout is paid win or lose: a fee paid only on losing makes losing
 * worth 10% of the price, so a scout who values a player at v stops bidding
 * at v / 1.1. Paying the same 10% on a win moves that point back to exactly v.
 * A rebate larger than the fee would push it past v and make nominating a race.
