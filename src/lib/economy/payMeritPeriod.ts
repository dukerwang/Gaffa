/**
 * Gaffa — Merit period payout
 *
 * Called from the matchup processor when a gameweek finishes. If that gameweek
 * closes a merit period (GW4, 8, ... 36, 38) every club in the league is paid
 * for its results across that period.
 *
 * Deliberately hooked into gameweek resolution rather than a new cron route:
 * vercel.json does not schedule every /api/cron/* route (process-auctions,
 * process-loans and others are triggered externally), so a payment on its own
 * schedule could silently never fire. Tying it to the resolution it depends on
 * means it cannot drift.
 *
 * Safe to call for every finished gameweek — non-boundary gameweeks return
 * immediately, and the credit RPC rejects a period that has already been paid.
