-- Gaffa — Migration 164: held players (part 4 of 4) — auction settlement
--
-- Requires 162 (team_is_holding, team_active_count, team_roster_limit,
-- withdraw_team_bids_for_hold).
-- Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-held-players-design.md, rules R16–R20.
--
-- resolve_single_player_auction_rpc from 152, with exact text edits applied to
-- the live definition in the same way:
--
--   * Room is counted by team_active_count / team_roster_limit, the same rule as
--     src/lib/roster/capacity.ts. 152 counted loaned-in players and ignored
--     buyback places, so a bid that passed placement could fail here.
--   * A bidder whose team is holding a player is skipped ('players_held').
--   * Second pass (R17): if nobody with room could take the player, the highest
--     bidder who could afford him wins and he is held. "Only uncontested bids
--     can be held" (Duke, 2026-09-13). The first 'roster_full' rejection is that
--     bidder, because bids are walked highest first.
--   * A held win withdraws the winner's other live bids once this auction's
--     claims are settled (R19), and the result reports them.
--
-- RELEASE ORDER. The unnumbered Scout's Fee migration on feat/scout-fee-both-ways
-- patches two lines of this function in place. Both lines are left untouched
-- here and must still match exactly once after this applies; apply that
-- migration after this one.

-- resolve_single_player_auction_rpc — from 152.
